# A Micro G Installer, for Android 14 (Nothing Phone 2 [Pong] - Pixel 8 [Shiba])
# This is a fork of 532910's MicroG installer
# THIS WILL NOT BE GIVEN SUPPORT!!!!!!!!

This is just a fork that adds Micro G with Playstore and nothing else!
On my personal Pong and Shiba i cannnot install any Micro G installers without using magisk
as there seems to be an issue with free space on both devices @ /mnt/system with crDroid
I'm hoping this works!

NO SUPPORT WILL BE GIVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

With thanks to 532910



This is a simple rework of [fdroid privileged-extension](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/privileged-extension)
that icludes [microG](https://github.com/microg) and [Aurora Services](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/AuroraServices)
and supports installation on [crDroid](https://crdroid.net/) 9.

This is not a project that I'm gonna support, just sharing my experience.

Only OTA updates will be survived. Trying to do `Local update` will remove installed apps.
