# A script to install Micro G!
Forked from @532910's Micro G installer!

First things first this is not a supported project and support is not promised or planned at all!!!
It's just a means to an end until other more smarter people fix issues with their installers

So if you have a device (Android 14) and are running a rom like eg CrDroid this is for you.
Why use this script?
   - Works with CrDroid Recovery
     - Issues with /mnt/system storage fixed by using the Product partition
     - Not wanting to use Magisk or Safetynet/Integrity modules (Most roms pass by default so there is no need unless you need root access)
     - Working Playstore (Changed to Aurora Store)
     - OTA support (Untested Don't use on local upgrades)
     - Uninstaller (Nothing written yet)

This installer uses the latest version of all apps at the time and yes even though it's depredecated (Aurora Store EXT) it's included until I change it

Feature's
   - The Aurora Store
   - The Aurora Store EXT installer
   - The F Droid Store
   - The F Droid EXT Installer
   - Micro G's GMS Core
   - Micro G's GMS Core Proxy
   - Micro G's Location Services
   - Micro G's FakeStore
   - PLANNED OTA Survival (Currently untested and AGAIN PLANNED NOT 100%%%)
   - Banking apps such as Starling are working fine! (CURRENTLY!!!)



#I would also like to provide thanks to 532910 for the original flashable script and installer! <3
