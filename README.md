# An official un supported Micro G Installer!
Forked from 532910's Micro G installer

Again this will not be supported in anyway shape it's just a mean to an end
If you really want to fork and fix things please do so in your own repo

Currently on my Nothing Phone 2 / Pixel 8 (Android 14) I can't install any micro g installer due to an issue with /mnt/system storage space and on some other installers
there seems to just be an issue with CRDroids recovery

Until everything is fixed I plan to use this to install Micro G with a working Playstore so I can access apps and use family library etc etc (More for apps really)

#Currently untested!!!
// Installer
// OTA


#I would also like to provide thanks to 532910 for the original flashable script and installer! <3
